**Note that the PCRaster Processing Tools are now available through the official QGIS Plugins repository**

**See https://jvdkwast.github.io/qgis-processing-pcraster/ for more info**

The user models and scripts now only work with the PCRaster Tools plugin installed!

Use the QGIS Resource Sharing plugin for adding the models and scripts to the Processing Toolbox: https://qgis-contribution.github.io/QGIS-ResourceSharing/
